# CSCI230 Fall 2018
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms

This course reviews and develops the abstract data type as mathematical models. Data structures and algorithms are developed as the objects and operations of abstract data types. Topics include lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, searching, sorting, and analysis of the efficiency of algorithms. Lectures three hours per week.

Prerequisite(s): CSCI 221 with a grade of C- or better and MATH 207.


## Topics Covered

- Asymptotic analysis of ADTs and algorithms
- Linear data structures including stacks, queues, and lists
- Tree data structures including binary, binary search, and balanced binary trees
- Hashing (Open and Closed)
- Heaps and priority queues
- Graphs: Traversal, shortest path, and minimum spanning tree
- Sorting algorithms: bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap sort

## Learning Outcomes

1. Analyze algorithms using asymptotic analysis.
2. Distinguish between the notions of an abstract data type and physical data structure.
3. Apply stacks, queues, lists, trees, binary search trees, balanced binary trees, hash tables, heaps and
priority queues, and graph ADTs in computer solutions.
4. Implement ADTs and appropriate operations on ADTs.
5. Be able to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the use of specific data structures in specific
problem situations.
6. Distinguish between various sorting algorithms in terms of how they work and their efficiency in
specific problem situations.
7. Coding project that applies data structure and algorithm techniques.
